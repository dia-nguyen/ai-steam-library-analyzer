# AI Steam Analyzer App (WIP)
A fun ChatGPT-4 AI app designed to analyze your Steam library and give you its honest (and perhaps a bit cheeky) opinion on your gaming tastes.

The app is divided into three main components: the Steam Auth API, the ChatGPT Steam Library Analyzer API, and the Next.js frontend.

## Directory Structure
- /auth: Contains the Steam Authentication API, responsible for handling user authentication via Steam.
- /steam-ai-chatbot: Houses the ChatGPT Steam Library Analyzer API, which performs the analysis of users' Steam libraries.
- /steam-ai-chatbot-ui: The Next.js Frontend App providing the user interface for interaction with the Steam AI Analyzer.
